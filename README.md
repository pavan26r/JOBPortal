# Full Stack Job Portal Website (MERN + Clerk + Sentry)
This is a **Full Stack Job Portal Website** built with **MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN)**.  
The platform provides an end-to-end solution for **job seekers** and **recruiters**:  
- Job seekers can search and apply for jobs online, upload resumes, and manage their profiles.  
- Recruiters can post new job openings, manage published job posts, and handle incoming applications (accept/reject).  
Authentication is powered by **Clerk**, and **Sentry** is integrated for real-time error tracking, MongoDB query monitoring, and performance optimization.  
Finally, the project will be deployed on **Vercel** for production use.
